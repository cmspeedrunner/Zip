# Syntax

log - what you might know as the print function, log will display whatever you want to log, make sure you dont use "" and instead you use '' when logging<br>
EG: <b>log['Hello World!']<br></b>

log. - this will log a message but, as many times as you want, the "." denotes that it can be indefinite
EG: <b>log.['Hello World!']<<5>><br></b>
